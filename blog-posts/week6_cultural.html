			<h1>Week 6 Cultural Post - Stereotype Threat</h1>
			<p>Stereotypes are always annoying in any circumstance.  And as a minority, it's something that I'e come across many a time. Obviously, depending on the context and the level of comfort, some stereotypes can be made fun of and even brought out to be changed.</p>
			<p>I do get a lot of the math/bookworm/nerdy stereotypes. And while it's nice to have people automatically think you're better at something because of how you look, it does make me feel a little ashamed if I'm good at it.</p>
			<p>One prime example is that I think if I didn't think it was such a stereotype to be some asian programmer sitting at a desk typing away, I think I may have looked more into getting into Comp Sci or Engineering when going to college</p>
			<p>Ironically, it was finance that I got into, which had the same sort of stereotype.  Asians in finance were a dime a dozen. This time, however, made me realize that it didn't matter what I looked like, and I found that I had realized that I wanted to follow the philosophy of software development, and not worry about any sort of stereotype or associated connotations that come with it.</p>
			<p>In the end, postiive and negative stereotypes create untrue and unrealistic expectations of people even before they have a chance to try something. If you think you're supposed to be bad at something because a stereotype says you do, you might not try it and by default you'll never be good at it.  Or be discouraged very quickly when success doesn't happen right away.  It can also drive you away if it's a stereotype that does not necessarily have the most  positive connotation.</p>
			<p>Unfortuantely a lot of these steroetypes are embeded in society. In reality, there just needs to be trailblazers and first movers, to break stereotypes, whether through specific programs that could be controversial (affirmative action), or by students themselves, attempting to break stereotypes that were forced on them</p>
