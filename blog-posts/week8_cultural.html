			<h1>Week 8 Cultural Post - Dealing with Conflict</h1>
			<p>I've had an emotional conflict recently with one of my really good friends that live in California. We've been friends for a really long time, and we think in similar ways; we both grew up in NJ, but he recently moved to California because his job allowed him to.  Unfortunately, he also didn't know many people out there, and I would say he doesn't have as close friends as he does back in NJ than he does out there.</p>
			<p>Recently, he got involved with a girl who was causing him a lot of trouble. Now, I'm not afraid of giving advice - I would hope people would tell me when I'm doing something incredibly self destructive. However, this girl was very clearly (at least in my opinion) leading my friend on (she was already involved with someone else), and my friend was falling for her pretty hard, and ignoring the signals that she was probably not going to get involved with him.</p>
			<p>Now, all guys are subject to this at some point. Some people call it the "friendzone" but, like many others, you can make a decision to figure out where you stand with a member of the opposite sex - you ask them. And so I pushed him to ask this girl where he stood. And he refused - he figured all the communication between the two proved that there was something there, and that he didn't need to get out of his comfort zone to see where he stood.</p>
			<p>This went on for days - weeks. I stopped being polite and literally started to yell at him. And obviously he would react incredibly negatively to it, at times I would feel like he would purposefully not try to figure out his situation because I was pushing him so hard to do so. Finally, after getting other people's input, and realzing he had to actually do something about it, finally talked to the girl. And surprise - she wasn't looking to get involved with him the way he thought they would've.</p>
			<p>Now, you would think this would have solved this strain in our relationship. I'd argue this made it even worse. You see, my friendship with this guy is based on tough love and dumb arguments, but in the end, we would always be on the same page. We were not on the same page. He would not admit to me that what I told him to do was the right thing to do, and he thought he still had a chance with this girl, even after the rejection. Yet he still pursued it, and was still getting hurt. And that made me incredibly more angry, and caused me to yell at him more. Unsurprisingly, it didn't help, and that his response was to stop bringing her up when talking to me. But because he was still so invested - he basically stopped talking to me.</p>
			<p>Personally, I think what I did was right. I've been in similar situations before, and the only wrong way to go about it is to not bring up your intentions, if you have any. However, the way I went about doing so was probably wrong. I had been used to talking to my friend with tough love, and in a confrontational manner. However, talking about women versus talking about sports is two different beasts, and it's something that I was not conscious about, when talking to him.</p>
			<p>Ultimately, while my intent was good, my execution was poor. Dealing with topics as touchy as this does require a lot more tact, and that was something I lacked. My patience was very thin, and it was definitely pushed to the edge, and I reacted in kind. He has not talked to me about it recently, so I assume he's still caught up in it. I just wished I had approached this issue a little better. From here on out, I know when I deal with serious situations like these, I can't assume I can approach it the same way I approach other problems. I need to learn to be more tactful, and maybe put myself in his shoes a little more to make sure I get where he's coming from.</p>
