			<h1>Week 3 Technical Post - Javascript</h1>
			<p>Javascript seems to be a very important part of the web development community.  Within the last couple of years, the # of Javascript jobs have been the most in demand, as seen here:<br> <img src="http://blogs.sitepointstatic.com/images/tech/781-programming-skills-change.png" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"><br>
			There seems to be a bunch of reasons why people like Javascript, and why it becaome such a major part of the web development community. Here are a couple:</p>
			<p><b>Ease of learning and use</b> - while no languages are "easy" to learn, as all languages require lots of practice and use to get comfortable with, Javascript, at least compared to other more complicated languages like Objective-C, is a lot more readable, and, like many other scripting languages, is easier to pick up.  It also does borrow a lot from other more established languages as well, so if you're familiar with Java and C, or other scripting languages like Ruby or Python, it is easier to pick up.  It's also very fast, and reduces the load on the server.</p>
			<p><b>Ubiquity - Libraries/browsers/community</b> - relating to the ease of use, Javascript is supported by every browser, and has loads of libraries!  Therefore there is no need to worry about different versions being needed to be made depending on what your browser is. Also, since there are loads of libraries available, you don't need to reinvent the wheel every time you need more fucntionality - chances are there are already libraries available!  Buliding on top of that, that means the community is also very robust and strong - theres tons of resources available on the web, and people who are in he same cirumstance as you.</p>
			<p><b>Node, JSON, and XML</b> - Node allows you to run as if it was the server.  No need for server side languages - javascript is all self containing.  JSON and XML, two other ways to write, is also based off javascript.  These three things, however, are very prevalent in web development, and Javascript is interconnected amongst all three</p>
			<p>There are some negatives to using Javascript though.  This includes:</p>
			<p><b>Javascript is heavily based on JQuery</b> - Javascript itself is a fairly old language.  However the main reason it got into prominance was this library called JQuery.  Then and only then was it viable for web developent</p>
			<p><b>Security Issues</b> - a lot of security exploits are because of Javascript. Once you get code onto the client server, it can be used to exploit the user's system.</p>
			<p><b>Rendering</b> - while Javascript is available on all brwosers, it still can run slightly differently, and result in different outputs depending on the browser/system used.  This obviously causes a lot of headaches.</p>
			<p><b>Search</b> - because it's a scripting language, there is a lot less readable information regarding search terms, which could mae it hard to search for your page if it's built solely on Javascript</p>
