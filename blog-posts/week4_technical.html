			<h1>Week 4 Technical Post - Ennumerable Method - Map</h1>
			<p>I've used this method before, and I do see it come up in a lot of different solutions and on stack overflow, so I wanted to delve into it a little more.</p>
			<p>The example that the ruby documentation gives is</p>
			<p><b>(1..4).map { |i| i*i } #=> [1, 4, 9, 16]</b></p>
			<p>So, what it looks like to me, is that it's using the array built with (1..4), which is an array of 1 through 4, and going through each element, and replacing it with it's own square.  This seems like an incredibly useful thing to do if you want to replace things within the array. So you could do something similar, and if you instead did i + 1, you would replace each element with itself plus one, like so</p>
			<p><b>(1..4).map { |i| i+1 } #=> [2, 3, 4, 5]</b></p>
			<p>But I think you could go even further.  You if you had an array of names, you could modify the text to it.  Say you had a variable of <b>names = ['victor' 'vicky']</b>.  You could capitalize  like so:</p>
			<p><b>names.map { |name| name.capitalize } #=> ['Victor','Vicky']</b></p>
			<p>This could be very useful if you needed to adjust whole arrays of data.  Especially since you dont need to have extraneous loops to adjust data.</p>
