			<h1>Week 7 Technical Post - SQL Injections</h1>
			<p>SQL Injections, which have been around for a long time (even from 1998!), is still a significant source of web vulnerabilities today.  There are several main types of SQL injections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Classic SQL Injection</li>
				<li>Blind SQLI</li>
				<li>Database management system - specific SQLI</li>
				<li>Compounded SQLI</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Basically a SQL injection is using the SQL queries and adjusting the statements so that it will do something else besides the intended purpose of gathering data.  I'll try to go through a couple examples here.</p>
			<p>For example, in this instance, incorrectly filtered escape characters is used.  For example, using the following code in authentication procedure:</p>
			<p><pre><code>
	SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '' OR '1'='1' -- ';
			</pre></code></p>
			<p>could mean that any name would be returned, since 1 would always equal 1.  You could gain all information about the table users even if you didn't know a valid "name"</p>
			<p>Another example is when the fields are not checked for type constraints.  For example, if we put a_variable equal to 1;DROP TABLE users in the following query:</p>
			<p><pre><code>
	statement := "SELECT * FROM userinfo WHERE id =" + a_variable + ";"
			</pre></code></p>
			<p> it would be equivalent to this:
			<p><pre><code>
	SELECT * FROM userinfo WHERE id=1;DROP TABLE users;
			</pre></code></p>
			<p>Which would delete all the "users" from the table.</p>
			<p>There are multitudes of other types of SQLIs, but hopefully these examples give a pretty good idea of what they are.  Since SQL queries themselves are lines of code, and if the database creators don't focus enough on controlling the types of values and expressions within the queries, hidden commands and pulls can be executed with or without the user knowing.  Since databases are still such a huge part of business today, these SQLIs will most likely still be a large issue in general.</p>
