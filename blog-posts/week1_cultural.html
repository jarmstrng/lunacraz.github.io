			<h1> Week 1 Cultural Post</h1>
			<p>My impression of the DBC experience is a positive one.  I think the first part that Shereef talks about in the video is the most important part - where he says that the only way that the program worked from the beginning was that everyone walking in was there to improve themselves, make a change, and to vigorously challenge themselves to learn software development. The way that DBC is framed- as an experiment- where anything goes and everything is accepted, as long as you're attempting to grow as a developer/engineer, speaks a lot to me. If you know that everyone that goes into this program, is there to learn and become both a better person and software engineer, then you will be free to take chances, push yourself, and better yourself without a specific expectation of what you should get out of DBC.</p>
			<p>Hand in hand witht that concept is this "creator mindset" or "kitchen mindset" that Shereef discusses.  I've been stuck in the "consumer" or "table" mindset for a long time- I expect to put in X amount of value (dollars, time, etc.) and expect a product come out in return.  My career path has also been like that - I've been in finance and business my whole life, and I was taught to look at things on a pure return basis.  You put some $ in, and expect a return.  My functions were not creative either- I didn't create anything as an Analyst or a Consultant.  I just made reports and pretty presentations.  I want to make things.  I want to be a creator.  I want to be in a Kitchen working with other cooks, working together, learning from more experience chefs but also being able to teach inexperienced cooks, and create great dishes and food.  And I think I've changed my mindset to be more in this philosophy. In joining this program, I think it really is the culmination of this change in philosophy.  I'm confident that I can succeed, but I know DBC isn't a magical formula.  But I know I'll become a creator and become a better person.</p>
			<p>As a result, I think I would really thrive in this sort of environment. Everyone is coming in with a hunger to learn, create, and become a software engineer.  Everyone is making a big sacrifice for DBC. Software development for the most part, is a team building towards a goal. Along with what Shereef said about competitiveness, (it's really not in anyone's interest to be competitive) and a preference for pair-programming, I think it would be a great envrionment to become a beginner engineer, and I am excited to finally take a part in it.</p>
			<p>Sure, I'm nervous.  I know I won't like working potentially 80 hours a week (I've done that before in my previous job).  I know I'll be scared about not being able to find a job, or even worse, maybe even failing out of the program.  I know leaving a life of comfort in order to satiate some weird desire to become a software developer is probably not the "safe" thing to do.  But I look forward to the challenge.  I need a kick in the ass.</p>
			<p>I also look forward to sharing anxieties and frustrations with others who are in the same war trench as I am; sleepless, afraid, but deteremined to succeed.</p>
