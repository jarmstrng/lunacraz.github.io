			<h1>Week 3 Cultural Post</h1>
			<p>When I took the personal style thinking quiz, I ended up with two - Abstract Sequential, and Concrete Random.  I took a screen shot from <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">here</a>, and this is what the two styles indicate:<br>

			<p>Now, I'm not one to generalize ways of thinking or personality, because I really do believe everyone is different. But obviously I do think a lot of these terms apply to me.  I think from the Abstract Sequential, the traits that would help the most for DBC, is the fact that I wont shy down from providing a point, and using analysis and logic to apply to problems.  This, I believe, will be important when we come across coding challenges that we have no real idea how to do, but will need to use our current knowledge, and some guidance from others, to solve.  I also do recognize some of the disadvantages; I may not do as well in working with different viewpoints (especially if I see them as wrong), and I do not necessarily like routine.
			<p>For Concrete Random, the fact that this way of thinking promotes experimenting and doing, and also maybe doing things more independently, means that I like trying a lot of things myself to make sure it works. This, combined with logical thinking, I believe, is the best way to go in learning programming. However, again, I do feel restricted by certain guidelines, and am always looking outside the box.</p>
			<p>In regards to the actual prep work so far, the biggest challenge is time management. I have a full time job, but I also have other interests and hobbies littered throught the week.  Now, I still have time and weekends to work on DBC work, so I shouldn't have to sculpt my whole life around it.  I am on a couple soccer teams and like music a lot, so I should still be able to give 2-3 nights a week to those interests and be able to finish my work.  However, as time progresses, and since pair programming is something that is really endorsed, it becomes harder and harder to plan days to have pair programming, as well as having time itself to learn the material. For example, my Guided Pair Programming session this week was unfortunately not as great as I did not have enough time to review all the material before hand.  It was good that forced us to be a little more proactive in the session, but we were definitely more hung up on smaller issues like syntax than we should have been.</p>
			<p>It is somewhat related, as according to my styles, I like doing many things, at my own pace, and reject structure.  Although this is a little weird, because one of the major reasons I joined DBC was the fact that I needed some sort of structure to learn, as I had no idea what I was doing when I was trying to teach  myself.  Otherwise, everything else that I figured out through the course has been fairly exemplary of my learning techniques - I spent some time reading and reviewing material, but really only started to learn specific syntax and such when we started to do the challenges and exercises.</p>
			<p>In regards to the fixed vs growth mindset, I think it's a really good thing to think about, and try to adjust your way of thinking.  We've been taught, as students and professionals, to think in goals, successes, and to measure yourself that way.  This also means that failure is something that is incredibly stigmatized and detrimental to your growth.  However, those who can accept failure as learning experiences and ways to improve yourself, and not something that is a permanent record of your intelligence, will do better in the end.  If we can view things in life as learning experiences and ways to improve yourself; as long as you're putting in the right effort and know you're improving yourself, failure is secondary and you will end up being better off than before. You DO need to be honest to yourself, however.</b>
