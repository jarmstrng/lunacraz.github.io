			<h1>Week 5 Cultural Post - Pairing and Giving</h1>
			<p><b>Pairing</b></p>
			<p>I'll be totally honest. I had my doubts about pairing. Something about two people working together on soemthing, that to me, was very solo based.  Sure teamwork is incredibly important when it comes to software development, but I thought that was more the idea of each person had their own responsibilities, and that people worked together to make sure everyone was on the same page.  Pair programming seemed, at least to me, like it was maybe a waste.<p>
			<p>But obviously, there was something to it.  DBC wouldn't have been this successful, espousing pair programming, without there being an obvious upside to it.  Companies wouldn't be implementing pair programming unless it was a good use of resources to them.  Sure there would be some more time spent working on code, but the code would be more effecient, have less errors, have more different ways of thinking applied to it, and most likely be a lot more readable to others. I know personally, for example, I have problems really refactoring / fixing my code, since I would be the one coming up with the solution.<p>
			<p>But I really thank DBC for forcing us to do this pair programming.  I do believe it will be even better in person, working on the same terminal, but even with the google hangouts and the Stypi, it's just great to see how two different, unique individuals tackle challenges and problems. Even though we are all coming to DBC with the same desire to change our lives and our professions, and probably are more "mathy" than others, there's still so many different ways people come up with solutions.</p>
			<p>I also enjoy the social aspect of it. The overwhelming of pair programming experiences I've had so far have been a great exercise in meeting new people, figuring out who they are, and using that even to help with coding. I'll be honest, one of the things that turned me off to programming was the sort of a solo exercise, with "neckbeards" holed up in their little room, coding at the wee hours of the day.  Pair programming has obviously turned that stereotype on it's head.</p>
			<p><b>Feedback</b></p>
			<p>I have been getting mostly positive feedback from my partners. There is one thing that I can call out - clearly when there's a bad session, which I had at the beginning (I believe it was a lot of my fault, as I wasn't very comfortable with javascript, and the GPS was really funky for me); you can tell who the person giving feedback is.  I think since both of us were struggling, and it was a new thing, it definitely didn't reflect well on myself.  Personally, I don't take it the wrong way (beside the intial "omg I'm hated!??!"), as I know it wasn't the best session, and it's something I can definitely improve.</p>
			<p>But on the other end, writing feedback, for me, has always been a very easy thing.  I'll be the first to admit that I'm a fairly critical person, and if something that you did really didn't sit well with me, I'll very easily call it out. Now, I have learned to temper my over criticalness that can come out sometimes (it's a family trait, I swear), but I am very good, at least I believe, in giving positive feedback.  At least for me, it's a great feeling getting criticism reflects well on who you are and how you act.  So I try to give as much of it as possible.</p>
			<p>Now, it's always hard to write critical feedback for someone, but in my viewpoint, if someone is constantly getting positive feedback when they have real issues to fix, that's a huge issue in itself. While it's always a first reaction to react negatively to criticism (which I still do, admittedly, even though I can give it out really well, especially in soccer), I have learned that it's a necessity in becoming a better person.</p>
