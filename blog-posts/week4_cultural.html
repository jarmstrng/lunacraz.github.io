			<h1>Week 4 Cultural Post - The Second Tech Bubble?</h1>
			<p>The biggest issue I have with tech today is the fact that it seems like we are entering another tech bubble</p>
			<p>Now, I don't think it's a repeat of the early 2000s.  That happened because we had absolutely 0 idea what we were getting into as a society.  The Internet was barely 10 years old at that point, and the majority of the users used it for a far less amount of time.  As a result, all the businesspeople just saw the early potential, and assumed that the phenomenon of a digital society would continue to grow, even though culutural zeigeists take time.</p>
			<p>However, 10 years down the road, we are starting to see the same patterns; constant buzz and inflated numbers being thrown around for acquiring the next best app. Companies like Instagram and Snapchat are going for billions, yet there's been no real way of monetizing yet. Sure, advertising will answer a lot of these questions now that we have mechanisms to display advertising in all different formats now, but there's always a limited source of that</p>
			<p>There's also a lot of money being thrown around at new ideas that people don't fully understand.  One great example is Bitcoin.  Sure the idea of a cryptocurrency sounds great - currencty that's not tied to any government, but is as liquid as regular dollars. But the current systems are still in infancy; Mt. Gox, originally a Magic the Gathering trading site, that became the largest Bitcoin exchange, went bankrupt as millions of dollars of Bitcoin "disappeared".</p>
			<p>I think the best answer to allay these fears is that people don't constantly throw money at the "next big thing."  I hope companies nowadays invest in ideas that will actually turn a profit for the parent companies, and that people do a little more research at what they're investing in before they put a significant amount.</p>
			<p>Government interaction would be great as well.  While the Government is notorious for falling behind on anything new and trendsetting, it would be great to have Obama create or help create a loose tech governing panel, that maybe not set policy, but reccomend some sort of guidelines, and have a open forum amongst the leaders in the tech industry to talk about what's affecting tech today.  Net Neutrality, Payments, Singularity; all things that could benefit from a central organization that has no outside influence.</p>
