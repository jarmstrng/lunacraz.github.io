			<h1> Week 1 Technical Post</h1>
			<p>The three websites that I've chosen to discuss are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a>
				<li><a href="http://google.com">Google</a>
				<li><a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon</a>
			</ol>
			<h1>Reddit</h1>
			<div class="imagesizer">

			</div>
			<p>Reddit, for me, is my be all end all in terms of the internet.  Sure, Facebook or Google can do social media or search, and are vital parts of the Internet and daily life today, but Reddit, to me, is my connection both the Internet and the happenings on it, but also my connection to myriads of smaller communities, as well as keeping me up to date about news that I would normally not know about.<br><br>
			When I first started to use Reddit, I saw it as a boring, uninteresting site.  But it's functional, pragmatic, simple, and with the combination of the type of users, also progressive and liberal, even if there is a little bit of "being in a bubble".<br><BR>
			Basically what it does is aggregate and provide a mechanism of ranking user submitted content.  It's also broken down in what's called "subreddits" where fans of... say Game of Thrones fans can submit and rate content.<br><br>
			In terms of actual design and look and feel about the site, I like it. As I said before, at first it looked too simple, maybe even "ugly" to me, after I had been so used to the flashy sites with Flash when I first started using Reddit.  But it made digesting the information easier, the comment trees to be easily followed, and allowed quicker browsing and loading.  Everything is pretty much self explanatory and easy to get through; simplicity really works well there.<br><br>
			One of the biggest problems is that since there is so much content, it is fairly difficult looking into the past.  The search function does not work very well, and in general it's hard to look for a post, since there are no real ways to "tag" or give "attributes" to a submission.
			<br><br>
			All in all, it's a great site to kill time and great way to digest information in an up to date manner.  However, don't expect to keep track of everything, and the site itself can get very busy (slow due to traffic).
			<h1>Google</h1>
			<div class="imagesizer">
				<img src="Images/google.jpg">
			</div>
			<p>Google is one of the engine's of the internet.  Simple, functional, relevant, as well as interconnected and omnicscient, it drives so  many of daily user's browsing and information seeking.  It also connects people in what they're looking for, setting them down the right path.<br><br>
			Visually, I really like it.  The simplicity allows you to pack as much relevant information as possible.  It also allows them to add those celebatory images for different events and holidays.  Esepcially since when you first get to the google site, the Search bar, and two buttons, is really all you see.<br><br>
			Which takes us into of design and function. When the home page, which is really just the search bar, hasn't changed in terms of design since it's inception, you know the design and related fucntionality works-  especially if you know the different ways to search (by domain, with operators, etc.)<br><br>
			The only downsides for me, however, is once you get past the regular text search.  At least in my opinion, and I know this is a lot harder to search than vs. pure text, but the news, video, and Image search is not as robust and easy to search through as the regular search.  Text search for an image or video doesn't really make as much sense, especially if you're looking for visual elements.  Howerver this is less of a problem with Google versus how different media is stored and gathered.<br><br>
			All in all, it's hard to do search better than Google.  However once you get outside that core compentency, like videos or images, or try to do shopping or connecting to the other Google services, it's a little unwieldly.<br><br>
			<h1>Amazon</h1>
			<div class="imagesizer">
				<img src="Images/amazon.jpg">
			</div>
			<p>Amazon is comprehensive, predictive, easy, connected, but a little cluttered.<br><br>
			When it comes to online shopping, it's hard to beat Amazon. Especially with it's breadth of different products that is offered, the ease of delivering these items to your home, the user reviews, and algorithm that suggest items to be bought; no other shopping site offers that sort of total service.<br><br>
			Looking for products is easy. Looking for related products is also easy. And once you set up easy payment system, buying can be as simple as one click. And when you're a shopping website, it makes a lot of sense to make buying things incredibly easy, which Amazon does.<br><br>
			The only problem with the design of the site, is that since there is so many different things that are offered, there can be an overwhelming amount of options.  Unfortunately, there's really no way to be able to filter down on the options if it's something you don't know much about (you can filter by brand and cost, but if you're not knowledgeable, it's hard to exclude things you dont know about).<br><br>
			Ultimately, Amazon, as a shopping site, is the most comprehensive site out there.  And since theyre branching out into providing other services, like streaming video, it's only getting better.  However, they do offer possiblly too much, allowing quality products to be obfuscated by other lesser products.<br><br>
