			<h1>Week 7 Cultural Post - Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h1>
			<h2>Values</h2>
			<p>In that list of values, there's a bunch that stick out to me the most, which are: Achievement, Challenge, Creativity, Confidence, Freedom, Growth, Knowledge, Meaningful work, Merit, Recognition, Self-respect, and Wisdom.</p>			
			<p>I think, the value that really sticks out to me, at least in relation to DBC, is Achievement. My last biggest challenge, besides surviving my last three jobs, was graduating school and finding a job that matched my ambition, 
			and my skill set.  I had thought I found that with my first job, and I felt incredibly happy. It was during a down year- many of my classmates were having issues finding a job they wanted. Ever since then, however, I haven't felt
			that same sense of achievement that I've felt since then.  Sort of hand in hand with the value of "Challenge," nothing was challenging to me anymore.  Work hasn't been challenging for 6 years.  Sure I've had to work late and endure
			crazy deadlines, but I haven't taken a step back and really "admired" the fact that I've conquered anything.  Really, the last time I felt that, was when I started to try make my own music on my computer.  Because I had to 
			make myself learn new aspects of things I've never done before, creating simple songs gave me such a huge sense of achievement. I am certainly hoping that DBC (and it's been true so far), gives me a kick in the ass and forces me to step up,
			as I think once I graduate DBC and become a developer (hopefully), that sense of Achievement will rear it's head again and make me feel great.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Achievement - 5</li>
				<li>Challenge - 5</li>
				<li>Creativity - 4</li>
				<li>Confidence - 4</li>
				<li>Freedom - 4</li>
				<li>Growth - 5</li>
				<li>Knowledge - 5</li>
				<li>Meaningful work - 4</li>
				<li>Merit - 4</li>
				<li>Recognition - 4</li>
				<li>Self-respect - 5</li>
				<li>Wisdom - 4</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Advice</h2>
			<p>The last topic that someone asked my advice on is Meaningful Work. A lot of people have been asking me more about what I'm doing when I'm quitting my job, and the idea of meaningful work has been coming up a lot.  One of the main
			reasons I tell people why I'm quitting my job involves finally getting a career and workplace that I can find pride in. In really finding out what kind of things I liked doing in my free time, which came out to making/producing things,
			I figured that software development, which, in my opinion, is becoming the craftsmen of the 21st century, really speaks to me, and would make work meaningful.  I think a lot of the people I talked to about this agreed with me, and some 
			even started to get curious about DBC itself!</p>
			<h2>Values and Stereotype Threat</h2>
			<p>To be honest, I've thought about these sort of things a lot. It's the main reason why I quit my current career and am pursuing software development. As such, I also have a lot of different thoughts about how things can go wrong as well.
			I think stereotype threats can be combatted with these values - as long as you can stick to the core values, and let them dictate what your direction is, you wont be affected by the threat as much.  I think the worst thing you can do is 
			allowing yourself to fall victim of a stereotype threat, and have that dictate your decision making and your work.  Sticking to your values will combat that.</p>
			<p>One thing that I do think would help me a whole lot, that's related to yoga, is mediation. I know it definitely helps some of my friends get over anxieties and problems they come across, and I think the same would be true for myself as well</p>
