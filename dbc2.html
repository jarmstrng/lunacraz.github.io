			<h2>Victor's areas of interest:</h2>
			<p>Jersey City seems to get a bad rap, but it's cool, chill, and really underrated.  Much better than "Broboken" that's next to us.</p>
			<p>Wanna try out some places in Jersey City?  Here are some of the places to check out</p>
			<h3><a href="http://barcadejerseycity.com/">Barcade</a></h3>
			<p>Retro gaming and alcohol goes hand in hand!  Sister location to the Barcade in Brooklyn, it's a great place to go play retro aracade games, drink craft beer, and sneer at the hipsters, while you totally aren't one at all.</p>
			<h3><a href="http://www.zeppelinhall.com/">Zeppelin Hall</a></h3>
			<p>German styled beer hall, with huge interior, good food, and lots of German beer.  Don't try to come here to only have one or two drinks.  That's impossible.</p>
			<h3><a href="http://thirtyacres.tumblr.com/">Thirty Acres</a></h3>
			<p>Great fushion foodie styled restaurant. Even has some press in NYC!  The menu changes very quickly, so check out their tumblr to get up to date dishes.</p><br>
