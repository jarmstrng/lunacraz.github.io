	<p>The plan for the new site is to create a simple site.  I want basically only three boxes - one for the main content, one for the navigation to the right, and another "about me" box right underneath that.  I also do want to a footer box at the bottom.</p>
	<p>I plan to keep space open on the right for any additional boxes</p>
	<p>This is the simple wireframe that I put together for this</p>
