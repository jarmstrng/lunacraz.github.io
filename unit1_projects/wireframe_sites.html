	<p>The problem Reddit is trying to solve is how to present to you, in the best way possible, the "hottest" submissions.  Basically, there is a limited amount of space on the screen, and a since it is the "hottest" designation, where time is a factor, Reddit is trying to present as much relevant submissions, ranked in a fashion that would be interesting to you.  I think it does a fair job of doing so, especially with the images.

	<p>This page is pretty simple- basically trying to get the user to search ASAP without any distractions.  Once they get a basic search going and see what kind of results there are, thats when they can start throwing their results / advertising at you.

	<p>Amazon's main page is trying to basically do three things; show it's main categories of shopping (left); show you any great deals relevant possibly to the date (father's day); and to also offer some recommendations based on your browsing history.  The middle is a combination of everything, as well as a search bar.</p>
